= The Basics

In order to use connect you need to understand some basics about Pathom's core features.  These are covered in detail in
xref:core.adoc[Core], but you'll easily understand the basics we need for connect without going into great detail.

You're going to be defining a *parser* that uses an *environment* and *graph query* to produce a *tree of data* from
arbitrary data sources.

If you're unfamiliar with the EQL, you should first read up on that in the
http://edn-query-language.org[EQL documentation].

Some simple examples of what we're doing are:

```
;; query
[:person/name]

;; possible result
{:person/name "Samantha"}

;; query
[:account/id
 {:billing/charges [:charge/amount]}]

;; possible result
{:account/id 1
 :billing/charges [{:charge/amount 11}
                   {:charge/amount 22}]}
```

To make sure we're on the same page, here's a quick review of the vocabulary:

[Horizontal]
Environment:: A map of configuration and context that is used to configure the parser and is also passed to the reader.
Resolver:: A Pathom Connect component that you write to indicate ways in which data attributes can be resolved against your data sources.  Resolvers are composed together into a connect-based *Reader*.
Reader:: A component that attempts to resolve elements of the query (one
at a time).  When using connect you also use a built-in *Map Reader* that can pull attributes which are already in the environment without having to do further work against your underlying resolvers and data sources.
Connect Indexes:: A set of indexes that are filled with resolver data and allow connect to understand how graph queries can be resolved by the resolvers.

== Baseline Boilerplate

Connect can generally be set up with the minimal steps every time.  Other sections of this book cover the options in
more detail but for the moment let's take this small bit of code as a general "starting point" for writing a connect-based
query processing system:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns com.wsscode.pathom.book.connect.getting-started
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]
            [com.wsscode.pathom.connect :as pc]))

;; Define one or more resolvers
(pc/defresolver some-symbol [env input] ...)
(pc/defresolver some-other-symbol [env input] ...)
...

;; resolvers are just maps, we can compose many using sequences
(def my-app-registry [some-symbol some-other-symbol])

;; Create a parser that uses the resolvers:
(def parser
  (p/parallel-parser
    {::p/env     {::p/reader               [p/map-reader
                                            pc/parallel-reader
                                            pc/open-ident-reader
                                            p/env-placeholder-reader]
                  ::p/placeholder-prefixes #{">"}}
     ::p/mutate  pc/mutate-async
     ::p/plugins [(pc/connect-plugin {::pc/register my-app-registry}) ; setup connect and use our resolvers
                  p/error-handler-plugin
                  p/trace-plugin]}))

; note the parallel parser call will return a channel, you must read the value on it
; to get the parser results
